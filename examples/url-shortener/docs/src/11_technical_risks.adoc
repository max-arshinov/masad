== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Technical Debts

- Missing comprehensive load testing for peak traffic scenarios (416K RPS)
- No automated scaling policies for database read replicas
- Analytics pipeline lacks backpressure handling mechanisms
- Monitoring dashboards missing for RPS thresholds and DB growth
- Cache warming strategy undefined for cold starts
- Data archival automation not implemented for 3-year retention
- Disaster recovery procedures incomplete for multi-node failures
- Performance benchmarking absent for CDN cache hit ratios
