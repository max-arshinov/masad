=== Technical Debts

- Missing comprehensive load testing for 1.2M+ events/sec sustained throughput
- Lack of automated failover procedures for ingestion pipeline components  
- No runbooks for query performance degradation scenarios
- Missing monitoring dashboards for end-to-end data processing latency
- Incomplete disaster recovery testing for multi-region data replication
- No automated cost optimization policies for storage lifecycle management
- Missing synthetic transaction monitoring for analyst user journeys
- Lack of automated GDPR/CCPA compliance validation workflows
- No capacity planning automation for 10% annual growth projections
- Missing performance regression testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Incomplete documentation for operational procedures and troubleshooting
- No automated alerting for query consistency variance detection
