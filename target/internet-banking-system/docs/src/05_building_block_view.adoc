== Building Block View



=== Whitebox Overall System



_**<Overview Diagram>**_

The Building Block View provides a static decomposition of the "Where's Fluffy?" system into its fundamental building blocks, detailing modules, components, subsystems, tiers, operations, and their interdependencies. This view acts like the floor plan of a house, providing a clear and organized structure.

Motivation::

The Building Block View helps maintain an overview of the source code by abstracting its structure. This allows for effective communication with stakeholders without delving into implementation details, making the system's architecture more accessible and comprehensible.


==== Level 1: System Context

Contained Building Blocks::
This is the main system that users interact with for posting and finding lost pets.

Important Interfaces::
- User Interface (Web and Mobile): Facilitates interaction between the users and the system. Ensures that users can register, log in, view pets, and communicate effectively.
- API Gateway: Acts as an entry point for all API requests, ensuring secure and efficient communication between clients and the backend services.
- Database Interface (MongoDB): Manages data storage and retrieval for user information, pet data, and transaction records. Ensures data integrity and security.


=== Level 2: Main Components (Blue Box)

The decomposition of the "Where's Fluffy?" system into its main components ensures clarity and manageability. By breaking down the system into distinct modules, each with a specific responsibility, we can facilitate development, maintenance, and scalability. This approach allows each component to be developed and tested independently, promoting modularity and reusability.
