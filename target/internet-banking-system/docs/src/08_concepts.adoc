== Cross-cutting Concepts


=== Domain Concepts

Definition::

Domain concepts define the core entities, relationships, and rules pertinent to the "Where's Fluffy?" service.


==== Pet Entity

Includes attributes like ID, Name, Breed, Color, Last Seen Location, etc.

==== User Entity

Includes attributes like ID, Name, Email, Phone Number, Role (Pet Owner, Finder, etc.)


==== Pet Report

Links Pet and User entities, with attributes like Status (Missing, Found), Report Date, Reward, etc.

Implementation::

Utilize a domain model to structure these entities, ensuring consistency in how data is managed and referenced across the system.


=== User Experience Concepts (UX)

Definition::

User experience concepts focus on the usability and accessibility of the system.

==== Responsive Design

Ensure the platform is usable across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

==== User Flow

Define intuitive navigation paths for users to report a missing pet, post found pets, and communicate.

==== Accessibility

Adhere to standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to support users with disabilities.

Implementation::

Develop wireframes and prototypes to validate the user interface and experience. Perform user testing to refine usability.

=== Safety and Security Concepts

Definition::

Safety and security concepts ensure the protection of data and the integrity of the system.

==== Data Encryption

Encrypt sensitive user data and communication (e.g., SSL/TLS for data in transit).

==== Authentication and Authorization

Implement secure login mechanisms and role-based access control.

==== Photo Proof Validation

Ensure the integrity of uploaded images with verification processes.

Implementation::

Use standard security frameworks and libraries. Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

=== Architecture and Design Patterns

Definition::

These concepts provide the architectural and design principles guiding the system's construction.

==== Microservices Architecture

Consider breaking down the system into microservices for better scalability and maintainability.

==== Repository Pattern

For data access, use repository patterns to abstract and manage database interactions.

==== Observer Pattern

Implement for notification systems, e.g., alerting users when a pet is found.

Implementation::

Document architectural decisions and design patterns. Ensure consistent application across the system components.

=== "Under-the-Hood" Concepts

Definition::

Technical implementation details that affect multiple components.

==== Logging and Monitoring

Define a standard format for logs and set up centralized logging systems for monitoring and troubleshooting.

==== Error Handling

Establish a consistent approach to error management and user notifications.

Implementation::

Adopt common tools and practices for logging (e.g., ELK Stack) and error handling. Document these practices for developers.

=== Development Concepts

Definition::

Best practices and standards for development.

==== Code Standards

Define coding conventions and style guides.

==== Version Control

Use Git for version control, with a branching strategy for feature development, bug fixes, and releases.

==== Testing

Implement a testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

Implementation::

Create development guides and automated CI/CD pipelines to enforce standards and streamline development processes.

=== Operational Concepts

Definition::

Operational practices for maintaining and managing the system.

==== Deployment

Define deployment strategies, including staging and production environments.

==== Backup and Recovery

Implement backup procedures and disaster recovery plans.

==== Scalability

Plan for scaling resources based on demand, e.g., auto-scaling policies for cloud services.

Implementation::

Document operational procedures and create runbooks for system administrators. Ensure that backup and recovery processes are regularly tested.

- Logging is relevant across user management, pet reports, and communication components.
- Security affects user registration, pet report management, and communication.
